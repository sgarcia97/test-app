He is the Son of God, God the Son, and the Son of Man.\r\n        <span >(Genesis 3:15, Isaiah 7:14, Matthew 1:18-25, Matthew 16:13-16)</span></p>\r\n        <h3>Atonement&nbsp;</h3>\r\n        <p>We believe that the salvation of sinners is divinely initiated and wholly of grace through the mediatorial offices of the Son of God, who by the appointment of the Father, freely took upon Him our nature, yet without sin, honored the divine law by His personal obedience and by His death made a full and vicarious propitiation atonement for our sins through His blood. His atonement consisted not in setting us an example of his death as a martyr but was the voluntary substitution of Himself in the sinner&apos;s place the just dying for the unjust. Christ the Lord, bearing our sins in His own body on the tree and having risen from the dead is now enthroned in Heaven and uniting in His wonderful person the most tender sympathies with divine perfection. He is, in every way, qualified to be a suitable, compassionate, and all-sufficient Savior.&nbsp;\r\n            <span >(Ephesians 2:8, Acts 15:11, John 3:16, Matthew 18:11, Philippians 2:7-8, Hebrews 2:14, Isaiah 53:4-7, 1 John 4:10, 1 Corinthians 15:3, 2 Corinthians 5:21)</span>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>Salvation</h3>\r\n        <p>We believe that salvation is a gift of God&apos;s grace to whosoever will and is received by repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ whose precious blood was shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of our sins. Salvation is &quot;by grace through faith&quot; plus nothing and minus nothing &nbsp;<span >Acts 20:21; John 1:12, 3:16, I Peter 1:18-19,23, Ephesians 2:8-10, John 1:12, Ephesians 1:7</span></p>\r\n        <h3>Eternal Security and State&nbsp;</h3>\r\n        <p>We believe that the believer who has exercised saving faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is in possession of a salvation which is eternally secure and that the believer shall be bodily resurrected unto eternal life with Christ in Heaven. The unbeliever will be resurrected unto everlasting punishment in Hell.<span >&nbsp;(John 10:28-29, Acts 24:15, Matthew 25:31-46)</span></p>\r\n        <h3>Second Advent of Christ</h3>\r\n        <p>We believe in the “blessed hope;” the personal, imminent pre-tribulation and pre-millennial coming of the Lord Jesus Christ for His redeemed ones, and His subsequent return to earth, with His saints, to establish His millennial Kingdom.&nbsp;<span >(1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Zechariah 14:4-11, Revelation 19:11-16; 20:1-6, 1 Thessalonians 1:10; 5:9, Revelation 3:10)</span></p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit</h2>\r\n        <p>We believe that the Holy Spirit is a person and convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; and that He is the Divine Teacher who guides believers into all truth and is the supernatural agent in regeneration indwelling and sealing them unto the day of redemption. The Holy Spirit empowers believers for Soul-Winning and Local Church Ministry <span >(John 16:8-11; II Cor. 3:6; Romans 8:9; Eph. 1:13, 14, Acts 1:8, 1 Corinthians 12:4-11; 28:13-18; 14:12, 2 Corinthians 12, Ephesians 4:7-12)</span></p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>The devil or satan</h2>\r\n        <p>We believe that Satan is a real and personal being. Satan was once holy, and enjoyed Heavenly honors; but through pride and ambition to be as The Almighty God, fell and drew after him a host of angels. He is now the malignant prince of the power of the air, and the unholy god of this world. We hold him to be the author of sin and the cause of the fall of Man; that he is the open and declared enemy of God and man; the accuser of the saints, the author of all false religions, the chief power source of the present apostasy, the lord of the antichrist; and that he shall be eternally punished in the Lake of Fire, a place prepared for him and his angels.<span > (Job 1:6-7, Isaiah 14:12-17, Matthew 4:1-11; 25:41, I Peter 5:8, Revelation 20:10, Ezekiel 28:14-17, Revelation 12:9, Jude 1:6, 2 Peter 2:4, Ephesians 2:2)</span></p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>The Creation</h2>\r\n        <p>We believe in the Genesis account of Creation, that God was the creator of all things, visible and invisible, who in six literal, twenty-four-hour periods, created and prepared &quot;Heaven and Earth and the sea, and all things that are therein&quot;; that man was created of the dust of the ground, directly in God&apos;s own image and after His own likeness; that man&apos;s creation was not a matter of evolution or evolutionary change of species, or development through interminable periods of time from lower to higher forms; that all animals and vegetable life was made directly and God&apos;s established law was that they should bring forth only &quot;after their kind&quot;.<span > (Genesis 1-2, Exodus 20:11, John 1:3, Colossians 1:16-17)</span></p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Man&apos;s Condition</h2>\r\n        <p>We believe that man was created in the image and likeness of God, but that he sinned, and physical and spiritual death resulted; that in Adam&apos;s sin the race fell, inherited a sinful nature, became alienated from God and is totally unable to regain its former position. <span >(Gen. 1:26; 3:1-24; Rom. 3:23; 5:12; Eph. 2:12, Genesis 3:1-6; 24, Romans 5:12; 3:10-19, Ephesians 2:1, Romans 1:18)</span></p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>The Church</h2>\r\n        <p>We believe that the local New Testament church is an organized body of born again believers immersed upon credible confession of faith in Jesus Christ recognizing only two offices filled by Pastor and Deacons, sovereign in polity and bonded together for work, worship, mutual edification, observances of the ordinances: baptism and the Lord&apos;s supper. As well as the worldwide proclamation of the Gospel. <span >Matthew 16:15-20; 18:20, Acts 2:38; 41-42; 13:1-4, Ephesians 1:22-23; 4:11-16; 5:25-27, Hebrews 10:25; 12:23</span></p>\r\n        <p>The word &quot;church&quot; in the New Testament refers to the local church and God&apos;s work today is primarily being carried on through the ministry of local churches <span >(I Tim. 3:15, Matt. 16:18)</span></p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>Baptism</h3>\r\n        <p>We believe that scriptural baptism is by full-body immersion in water of a believer; in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost; and that it is invalid unless it is performed by the proper authority, which is the local New Testament church, to show forth in a solemn and beautiful emblem our faith in the crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, and that it is a pre-requisite to the privileges of a church relation and to the Lord&apos;s supper. &nbsp;<span >(2 Timothy 3:1-5, Romans 12:1-2; 14:13, 1 John 2:15-17, 2 John 1:9-12, 2 Corinthians 6:14; 7:11)</span></p>\r\n        <i>No special or mystical grace is imparted to the recipient. Baptism is a simple act of identification with Jesus Christ and a picture of what has happened spiritually at the time of salvation.</i>\r\n\r\n        <h3>The Lord&apos;s Supper</h3>\r\n        <p>We believe the LORD Jesus Christ instituted the Lord&apos;s supper the same night wherein He was betrayed, to be observed in His churches until His return to take us to Heaven for the remembrance of His sacrificial death, and His speedily return. The elements are unleavened bread, typifying our Lord&apos;s broken body and the unfermented fruit of the vine, pure grape juice, typifying our Lord&apos;s shed blood remitting our sins; the partaking of the Lord&apos;s supper is always preceded by a solemn self-examination of one&apos;s own heart and life.</p>\r\n        <i>The Lord&apos;s supper is a memorial. No special or mystical grace is imparted to the recipient.</i>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Prophecy</h2>\r\n        <p>We believe in the personal, imminent, and pre-tribulational return of Christ for His saints known as the Rapture, also that Christ will have a personal pre-millennial return to the earth to reign over a literal earthly kingdom for one thousand years. \r\n            <span >(I Thes. 4:16-18; Acts 15:14-18; Rev. 1:11-16; 20:6; II Sam. 7:12-16; Zech. 14:4-11)</span>\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>The Security of the Believer</h2>\r\n        <p>We believe that all the redeemed, once saved, are kept by God&apos;s power and are thus secure in Christ forever. \r\n            <span> (John 6:37-40; 10:27-30, Romans 8:1, Ephesians 1:13-14, I Peter 1:4-5)</span>\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n            <span >NB: The Scripture references are representative; not exhaustive.</span>\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        </PageLayout>\r\n        </>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Page;"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;;;;;AACA,MAAM,OAAO;IACT,qBACI;;0BACA,8OAAC,4HAAA,CAAA,SAAM;;;;;0BACP,8OAAC,2HAAA,CAAA,QAAK;gBAAC,OAAM;;;;;;0BACb,8OAAC,gIAAA,CAAA,UAAU;;kCAEX,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCAEJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAAwZ,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCACla,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAA4E,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCACtF,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAAyL,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCACnM,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAAoK,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAG9K,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCAEJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAAmW,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAE7W,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CACH,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCACP,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CACC,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAEX,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAAsT,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAChU,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAAiT,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAC3T,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAAkP,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAE5P,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAAwW,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAElX,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAAgpB,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAE1pB,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAA2qB,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAErrB,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAAkR,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAE5R,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAAyZ,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCACna,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAA2K,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAErL,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CAA0c,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCACpd,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;kCAEH,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;kCACH,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;kCAEH,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CACC,8OAAC;0CAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAGX,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CACC,8OAAC;0CAAK;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAGV,8OAAC;kCACG,cAAA,8OAAC;sCAAM;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAMnB;uCAEe"}},
